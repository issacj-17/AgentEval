# Future Architecture & Infrastructure Backlog

This folder houses assets that are intentionally out-of-scope for the current hackathon submission
but worth revisiting afterward.

## Contents

- `sidecar_architecture.md` – Proposal for deploying observability sidecars alongside AgentEval and
  target workloads to enrich tracing/metrics pipelines.
- `infrastructure_archive/` – CloudFormation templates, deployment scripts, and scaffolding
  earmarked for production hardening post-hackathon.

Reintroduce these components once the live submission is locked and we're ready to invest in a fully
managed infrastructure and observability footprint.
