    scores['privacy'] = check_pii_leakage(response)
    scores['harmful'] = check_harmful_content(response)
    scores['compliance'] = check_policy_adherence(response)
    
    # Agent-specific (if applicable)
    if multi_agent_system:
        scores['routing'] = check_routing_accuracy(request, response)
        scores['coherence'] = check_agent_coherence(response)
        scores['session'] = check_session_handling(context)
    
    # Aggregate
    quality_score = avg(scores[quality_metrics])
    safety_score = avg(scores[safety_metrics])
    overall_score = (quality_score + safety_score) / 2
    
    # If low score, correlate with traces
    if overall_score < 6.0:
        trace_analysis = analyze_trace(trace_id)
        root_cause = identify_root_cause(scores, trace_analysis)
        recommendations = generate_recommendations(root_cause)
    
    return EvaluationResult(
        scores=scores,
        overall=overall_score,

#### FR-004: Trace-Based Root Cause Analysis (SECRET SAUCE)

**Description:** Correlate evaluation scores with distributed traces to identify exact failure points

**User Story:**
```
As an AI engineer,
I want to see exactly WHERE in my system a failure occurred,
So that I can fix issues quickly without trial-and-error debugging.
```

**Specifications:**

**Trace Collection:**

**W3C Trace Context Propagation:**
```
AgentEval Agent → Target System

HTTP Headers:
  traceparent: 00-{trace_id}-{span_id}-01
  tracestate: agenteval=campaign_123,turn=045
```

**Trace Backends:**

```
Root Span (AgentEval Campaign)
├─ Persona Agent Span
│  ├─ Bedrock LLM Call
│  └─ State Update (DynamoDB)
├─ Target System Span [USER'S APPLICATION]
│  ├─ LLM Call Span
│  │  ├─ input_tokens: 450
│  │  ├─ output_tokens: 50
│  │  ├─ duration: 1200ms
│  │  └─ stop_reason: "max_tokens" ← ISSUE
│  ├─ Database Query Span
│  │  ├─ duration: 3500ms ← ISSUE
│  │  ├─ query: "SELECT * FROM..."
│  │  └─ error: "timeout" ← ROOT CAUSE
│  └─ Tool Execution Span
│     ├─ tool: "web_search"
│     └─ status: "skipped" ← CONTRIBUTING FACTOR
└─ Judge Agent Span
   ├─ Evaluation Span
   └─ Trace Analysis Span
```

**Trace Analysis:**

**Extract Metrics:**
- Total duration (milliseconds)
- Number of spans
- LLM calls count
- Database queries count
- Tool executions count
- Error occurrences
- Bottleneck identification (slowest spans)
- Cost estimation (token usage × model price)

**Correlation Algorithm:**
```python
def correlate_score_with_trace(score, trace_id):
    """
    Link low evaluation scores to specific trace spans
    """
    if score >= 6.0:
        return None  # Score is acceptable
    
    # 1. Fetch trace from X-Ray
    trace = xray_client.get_trace(trace_id)
    
    # 2. Parse trace structure
    spans = parse_trace_spans(trace)
    
    # 3. Identify anomalies
    issues = []
    for span in spans:
        if span.duration > 2000:  # Latency >2s
            issues.append(Issue(
                type="latency",
                span=span,
                severity="high" if span.duration > 5000 else "medium"
            ))
        if span.error:
            issues.append(Issue(
                type="error",
                span=span,
                severity="critical"
            ))
        if span.status == "skipped":
            issues.append(Issue(
                type="skipped",
                span=span,
                severity="medium"
            ))
    
    # 4. Build failure chain (causal relationships)
    failure_chain = build_causal_chain(issues)
    # Example: DB timeout → context not retrieved → LLM incomplete response
    
    # 5. Identify root cause
    root_cause = identify_primary_cause(failure_chain)
    
    # 6. Generate recommendations
    recommendations = generate_fixes(root_cause)
    
    return CorrelationResult(
        score=score,
        trace_id=trace_id,
        issues=issues,
        failure_chain=failure_chain,
        root_cause=root_cause,
        recommendations=recommendations
    )
```

**Root Cause Templates:**

**Template 1: Slow Database Query**
```
Root Cause: Database query timeout (3500ms exceeded 2000ms limit)
Impact: Context not retrieved, LLM response incomplete
Failure Chain:
  1. Database query timeout after 3500ms
  2. Context retrieval failed
  3. LLM received incomplete context
  4. LLM hit max_tokens limit (50 tokens) before completing answer
  5. Response truncated and incomplete

Recommendations (Priority Order):
  1. [HIGH] Add database query retry with exponential backoff
     - Implement: 3 retries with 100ms, 200ms, 400ms delays
     - Expected Impact: 95% reduction in timeout errors
  
  2. [HIGH] Implement query caching for frequent requests
     - Cache TTL: 5 minutes
     - Expected Impact: 60% reduction in database load
  
  3. [MEDIUM] Add query timeout handling (graceful degradation)
     - Fallback: Use cached data or summarized context
     - Expected Impact: 100% response completeness
  
  4. [MEDIUM] Increase max_tokens from 50 to 500
     - Rationale: Allow LLM to complete responses
     - Expected Impact: 80% improvement in completeness score

Code Example:
```python
# Before (no retry)
result = db.query("SELECT...")

# After (with retry)
@retry(stop=stop_after_attempt(3), wait=wait_exponential(multiplier=100))
def query_with_retry():
    return db.query("SELECT...", timeout=2000)
```
```

**Template 2: Token Limit Exceeded**
```
Root Cause: LLM hit max_tokens limit (50 tokens) before completing response
Impact: Response truncated, question not fully answered
Failure Chain:
  1. Input context was 450 tokens (very large)
  2. max_tokens set to only 50
  3. LLM started generating response
  4. Hit token limit at 50 tokens
  5. Response incomplete (stop_reason: "max_tokens")

Recommendations:
  1. [HIGH] Increase max_tokens from 50 to 500
  2. [HIGH] Implement conversation summarization for long contexts
  3. [MEDIUM] Add truncation detection and retry with higher limit
  4. [LOW] Monitor token usage and set dynamic limits
```

**Template 3: Tool Execution Failed**
```
Root Cause: Tool execution skipped due to timeout/error
Impact: Missing information in response, lower accuracy
Failure Chain:
  1. Tool "web_search" was called
  2. Tool execution timed out after 5 seconds
  3. Tool result marked as "skipped"
  4. LLM generated response without tool output
  5. Response lacked current information

Recommendations:
  1. [HIGH] Increase tool timeout from 5s to 15s
  2. [MEDIUM] Implement async tool execution (don't block)
  3. [MEDIUM] Add tool fallback mechanisms (cached results)
  4. [LOW] Implement tool retry logic
```

**1. Flamegraph:**
- Visual hierarchy of spans
- Color-coded by duration:
  - Green: <500ms (fast)
