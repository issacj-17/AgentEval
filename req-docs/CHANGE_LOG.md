## Narrative Summary

- **Sep 8-12:** Initial project setup and architecture design

  - Created project structure and repository
  - Designed multi-agent architecture
  - Set up AWS infrastructure with CloudFormation

- **Sep 13-19:** Core agent implementation (Persona, Red Team, Judge agents)

  - Implemented BaseAgent abstract class
  - Created Persona agents with memory and behavior systems
  - Developed Red Team agents with attack library (50+ patterns)
  - Built Judge agents with evaluation metrics

- **Sep 20-26:** Trace correlation and observability integration

  - Integrated OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing
  - Implemented W3C Trace Context propagation
  - Connected AWS X-Ray for trace collection
  - Built TraceAnalyzer for root cause identification

- **Sep 27-Oct 3:** API development and campaign orchestration

  - Developed FastAPI REST endpoints
  - Implemented CampaignOrchestrator
  - Created state management with DynamoDB
  - Built event-driven architecture with EventBridge

- **Oct 4-10:** Testing infrastructure and documentation

  - Created unit tests for all major components
  - Wrote integration tests for end-to-end workflows
  - Developed comprehensive documentation (BRD, PRD, TAD, AGILE docs)

- **Oct 11:** **Comprehensive DI refactoring (Stages 1-6) - Major Architecture Improvement**

  - **Stage 1:** Implemented DI Container (`src/agenteval/container.py`)
    - Singleton pattern with lazy initialization
    - Lifecycle management (connect/close for all AWS clients)
    - Thread-safe with reset functionality
    - FastAPI integration via `Depends()`
  - **Stage 2:** Created Agent Factories (`src/agenteval/factories/`)
    - BaseFactory with Generic\[T\] typing
    - PersonaAgentFactory with YAML validation
    - RedTeamAgentFactory with attack configuration
    - JudgeAgentFactory with metric selection
  - **Stage 3:** Built Application Services layer (`src/agenteval/application/`)
    - CampaignService for campaign lifecycle management
    - ReportService for multi-format report generation
    - Framework-agnostic business logic
  - **Stage 4:** Refactored CampaignOrchestrator
    - Constructor injection for all dependencies
    - Agent creation via injected factories
    - Improved testability with dependency injection
  - **Stage 5:** Created comprehensive DI testing infrastructure
    - Enhanced `tests/conftest.py` with 12 DI-aware fixtures
    - Created `tests/test_utils.py` with mock builders and helpers
    - Implemented 74 new DI-related tests:
      - 12 orchestrator factory tests
      - 25 agent factory tests
      - 20 campaign service tests
      - 17 report service tests
    - Achieved 100% pass rate on all DI tests
    - Test coverage improved from 75% to 82%
  - **Stage 6:** Updated all documentation
    - README.md: Added DI architecture section and updated project structure
    - REFACTORING_PROGRESS.md: Documented all 6 stages in detail
    - API route updates to use DI container
  - **Impact:** Significantly improved testability, maintainability, and separation of concerns

- **Oct 12:** Final polish, demo preparation, and documentation synchronization

  - Synchronized all markdown files with DI refactoring changes
  - Updated PROGRESS_CHECKLIST.md (completion 90% â†’ 93%)
  - Enhanced TAD with DI architecture class diagrams (new section 6.4)
  - Updated AGENTS.md with DI container and factory examples
  - Updated CHANGE_LOG.md with detailed DI refactoring documentation
