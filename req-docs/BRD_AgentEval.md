## SECTION 1: BUSINESS PROBLEM & OPPORTUNITY

### 1.1 Problem Statement (McKinsey Problem Definition Framework)

**Core Problem:**

> Organizations building GenAI applications lack comprehensive, efficient, and actionable testing
> tools, resulting in costly production failures, security breaches, and poor user experiences.

**Problem Decomposition:**

**1. Testing Fragmentation (Critical)**

- **Current State:** Teams use 3-5 separate tools for evaluation, monitoring, and security
- **Pain Points:**
  - Integration overhead: 3-6 months setup time
  - Data silos: No unified view of application quality
  - Cost: $200K-$500K annual tooling costs
- **Impact:** Delays time-to-market by 4-6 months

**2. Unrealistic Persona Testing (High)**

- **Current State:** Manual testing or scripted bots with formulaic behavior
- **Pain Points:**
  - Doesn't catch real-world edge cases
  - Expensive: $150/hour for QA engineers
  - Slow: 2-3 weeks for comprehensive testing
- **Impact:** 60% of UX issues discovered post-launch

**3. Reactive Security Posture (Critical)**

- **Current State:** Security testing happens late in development cycle
- **Pain Points:**
  - Manual red-teaming: $50K-$100K per engagement
  - Latency: Guardrails add 50-200ms per request
  - Incomplete: Only 20-30% of OWASP LLM Top 10 covered
- **Impact:** 56.4% increase in AI security incidents (2024)

**4. Black Box Debugging (High)**

- **Current State:** When evaluations fail, developers don't know why
- **Pain Points:**
  - No visibility into LLM internals
  - Trial-and-error debugging: 8-10 hours per issue
  - Cannot reproduce issues reliably
- **Impact:** 40% of development time spent on debugging

### 1.2 Market Analysis (Porter's Five Forces)

**1. Threat of New Entrants: MEDIUM**

- Low barriers to entry (open-source LLMs, cloud platforms)
- High technical barriers (AI/ML expertise, distributed systems)
- Network effects favor early movers

**2. Bargaining Power of Suppliers: LOW**

- Multiple LLM providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, Meta)
- Cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP) compete for customers
- Open-source alternatives available

**3. Bargaining Power of Buyers: MEDIUM**

- Enterprise customers have significant purchasing power
- Switching costs are moderate (6-12 months)
- Performance requirements are non-negotiable

**4. Threat of Substitutes: MEDIUM**

- Manual testing (expensive, slow)
- In-house solutions (costly to build and maintain)
- Point solutions (fragmented, incomplete)

**5. Industry Rivalry: HIGH**

- Emerging market with multiple players
- Rapid innovation cycle
- Strong differentiation possible

**Conclusion:** Despite competitive pressures, AgentEval's unique trace-based root cause analysis
creates defensible differentiation.
