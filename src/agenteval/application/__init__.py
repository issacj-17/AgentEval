"""
Application Services Layer

This layer contains business logic and use cases that orchestrate
domain objects and infrastructure services.

Services in this layer:
- Accept dependencies via constructor injection
- Contain business logic previously scattered in API routes
- Return domain models, not HTTP responses
- Are framework-agnostic (no FastAPI dependencies)
- Are easily testable with mocked dependencies
