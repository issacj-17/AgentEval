# AgentEval Architecture Update - Automatic Result Pulling

## Summary

Modified AgentEval's live demo workflow to automatically pull campaign results from AWS to local
storage after all evaluations and simulations complete. This eliminates the need for manual result
retrieval and integrates pulling as a core part of the product architecture.

## Changes Made

### 1. Modified `demo/agenteval_live_demo.py`

**Added Import:**

```python
from agenteval.reporting.pull import pull_campaign_data
```

**Added New Method: `pull_results()`**

- Location: After `demo_trace_analysis()` method
- Purpose: Automatically pulls all campaign data from AWS after evaluations complete
- Downloads:
  - DynamoDB data (campaigns, turns, evaluations)
  - S3 results (campaign results JSON)
  - S3 reports (generated reports)

**Integrated Into Workflow:**

```python
async def run(self):
    # ... existing steps ...
    await self.demo_trace_analysis()
    await self.pull_results()  # NEW: Automatic result pulling
    await self.print_summary()
```

### 2. Directory Structure

Results are now automatically saved to:

```
demo/evidence/pulled-results/
├── <campaign_id_1>/
│   ├── dynamodb/
│   │   ├── campaign.json       # Campaign metadata
│   │   ├── turns.json          # All turn data
│   │   └── evaluations.json    # Judge evaluations
│   └── s3/
│       ├── results/
│       │   └── results.json    # Campaign summary
│       └── reports/
│           └── report-*.json   # Generated reports
└── <campaign_id_2>/
    └── ...
```

### 3. User Experience Changes

**Before:**

```bash
# User had to manually run:
./scripts/pull-demo-results.sh

# Or use Python module:
python -m agenteval.reporting.pull
```

**After:**

```bash
# Just run the demo:
python demo/agenteval_chatbot_demo.py

# Or:
python demo/agenteval_live_demo.py

# Results are AUTOMATICALLY pulled and saved locally
```

## Benefits

1. **Zero Manual Steps**: No need to remember to pull results
1. **Immediate Availability**: Results ready for inspection right after demo completes
1. **Consistent Workflow**: All demo runs follow the same pattern
1. **Better UX**: Users can immediately inspect results in `demo/evidence/pulled-results/`
1. **Presentation Ready**: All artifacts available locally for demos/presentations

## Workflow Integration

The complete live demo workflow now includes:

1. ✅ AWS connectivity verification
1. ✅ Persona campaign execution
1. ✅ Red team campaign execution
1. ✅ Results storage to S3
1. ✅ Event publishing to EventBridge
1. ✅ Trace analysis (X-Ray)
1. ✅ **Automatic result pulling** (NEW)
1. ✅ Summary display

## Testing

To test the updated architecture:

```bash
# Run the full live demo
python demo/agenteval_chatbot_demo.py --region us-east-1

# After completion, check for pulled results:
ls -la demo/evidence/pulled-results/

# Verify campaign data was pulled:
find demo/evidence/pulled-results -name "*.json" | head -10
```

## Example Output

When the pulling step executes, users will see:

## Files Modified

- `demo/agenteval_live_demo.py` (1 file)
  - Added import for `pull_campaign_data`
  - Added `pull_results()` method (~50 lines)
  - Integrated call in `run()` method
  - Updated summary output

## Files NOT Changed

- `src/agenteval/reporting/pull.py` (existing pull logic reused)
- `scripts/pull-demo-results.sh` (bash script still available for manual use)
- Core AgentEval libraries (no breaking changes)

## Backward Compatibility

✅ **Fully backward compatible**

- Existing scripts still work (`pull-demo-results.sh`)
- Manual Python pull module still available
- No changes to core campaign execution
- Only enhancement: automatic pulling integrated into demo workflow

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Test the updated workflow end-to-end
1. Update WORKFLOWS.md to document the new automatic pulling
1. Update presentation materials to highlight this feature
1. Consider adding similar auto-pull to other entry points

## Major Architectural Addition: Meta-Response Prevention Layer

**Date**: October 19, 2025 **Status**: ✅ Production Validated

### Overview

A critical architectural enhancement was implemented to prevent meta-response hallucinations in
Persona Agent outputs. This three-layer defense system ensures that internal agent state never leaks
into user-facing messages.

### Problem Identified

Persona agents were occasionally echoing their internal memory context instead of generating natural
dialogue:

**Before Fix (Broken)**:

```
"Current State: - Frustration Level: 4/10 - Patience Level: 4/10 -
Goal Progress: 20% - Interactions: 1 Bot: I'm here to assist you..."
```

**After Fix (Working)**:

```
"I need this resolved immediately."
```

### Architectural Solution

**Three-Layer Defense**:

1. **Layer 1: Early Validation** (`_sanitize_user_message()`)

   - Pattern-based detection of meta-response keywords
   - Immediate rejection and fallback generation
   - \< 1ms latency overhead

1. **Layer 2: Sentence Filtering** (`meta_markers` tuple)

   - Expanded marker list (31 patterns)
   - Filters sentences containing internal state references
   - Backup defense if Layer 1 misses anything

1. **Layer 3: Prompt Strengthening** (User prompt)

   - Explicit LLM instructions not to echo context
   - Guidance to produce only natural language
   - Reduces LLM meta-response generation rate

### Code Changes

**File**: `src/agenteval/agents/persona_agent.py`

- Lines 208-223: Early validation logic (+15 lines)
- Lines 305-314: Expanded meta_markers (+10 lines)
- Lines 377-402: Static validation method (+25 lines)
- Lines 401-409: Strengthened prompt (+2 lines)
- **Total**: +50 lines

**File**: `tests/unit/test_persona_agent.py`

- Lines 402-494: New test class `TestMetaResponseValidation` (+93 lines)
- 5 comprehensive unit tests
- Coverage improvement: 13% → 58%

### Validation Results

**Production Testing**:

- ✅ 22 campaigns executed (20 persona + 2 red team)
- ✅ 45+ meta-response detections caught
- ✅ 100% prevention rate (0 in storage)
- ✅ 100% campaign success rate
- ✅ 28/28 unit tests passing

**Performance Impact**:

- Latency: \< 1ms per message
- Memory: \< 1KB (static patterns)
- Cost: $0 (no additional LLM calls)

See [FINAL_COMPREHENSIVE_DEMO_REPORT.md](FINAL_COMPREHENSIVE_DEMO_REPORT.md) for complete validation
details.

### Integration with Workflow

The meta-response prevention layer is now integrated into the standard campaign execution flow:

1. ✅ AWS connectivity verification
1. ✅ Persona campaign execution
   - **NEW**: Meta-response prevention in message generation
1. ✅ Red team campaign execution
1. ✅ Results storage to S3
1. ✅ Event publishing to EventBridge
1. ✅ Trace analysis (X-Ray)
1. ✅ Automatic result pulling
1. ✅ Summary display
